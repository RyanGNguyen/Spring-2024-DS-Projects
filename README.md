This repository contains various basic data science projects I have completed over the course of the Fall 2023 (my Junior Fall) semester at Johns Hopkins University. The majority of my projects were completed as part of the Biomedical Data Science course along side its accompanying Biomedical Data Science Laboratory taught by Dr. Brian Caffo from the JHU Department of Biostatistics and Dr. Kwame Kutten from the JHU Department of Biomedical Engineering labeled under the BME-DS folder. These projects range from basic classification tasks using only the Sci-Kit Learn library to more advanced image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks using Pytorch. On the other hand, the AI folder contains my final project for the Artificial Intellgience course taught by Dr. Musad Haque of the JHU Department of Computer Science. This project measures the effectiveness of various neural network model configurations on a standard classification task using Pytorch.
